      "Okay, I need to write a Python function that implements a decorator. Let me think about how decorators work in Python. Decorators are functions that wrap another function to extend its behavior without modifying its code. They usually take a function as an argument and return a new function.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the basic structure of a decorator is something like:\n",
      "\n",
      "def decorator(func):\n",
      "    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n",
      "        # do something before\n",
      "        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
      "        # do something after\n",
      "        return result\n",
      "    return wrapper\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, you can apply it using the @ syntax above a function.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user wants me to write a function that implements a decorator. Maybe they want an example of a specific decorator? Since they didn't specify, maybe I should create a generic one with some example functionality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me think of a common use case. Maybe a timer decorator that measures the execution time of a function. Or perhaps a simple logger that prints when the function is called.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe a decorator that adds some behavior before and after. For example, a debug decorator that prints the function name and arguments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me go with that. Let's create a decorator called 'debug' that prints the function name and the arguments it was called with, and then returns the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the steps are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Define the decorator function, which takes 'func' as an argument.\n",
      "2. Define the wrapper function inside the decorator. It should accept any arguments (*args, **kwargs).\n",
      "3. Inside the wrapper, print the function name and arguments.\n",
      "4. Call the original function with those arguments.\n",
      "5. Return the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, how to get the arguments? The wrapper will receive them, then pass them to func.\n",
      "\n",
      "Testing this with an example function. Let's say:\n",
      "\n",
      "@debug\n",
      "def add(a, b):\n",
      "    return a + b\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, when add(3, 4) is called, the debug decorator should print something like:\n",
      "\"Calling add with arguments (3, 4), keyword arguments {}\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But how to capture the arguments? In the wrapper, before calling func, we can print args and kwargs.\n",
      "\n",
      "But maybe using the inspect module to get the function's parameters? Hmm, that might complicate things. For simplicity, maybe just print the args and kwargs as they are.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in the wrapper:\n",
      "\n",
      "def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n",
      "    print(f\"Calling {func.__name__} with args {args} and kwargs {kwargs}\")\n",
      "    result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
      "    return result\n",
      "\n",
      "That's straightforward. But maybe the user wants something more complex. However, the question is to write a function that implements a decorator. So this example should suffice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together:\n",
      "\n",
      "def debug(func):\n",
      "    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n",
      "        print(f\"Calling function '{func.__name__}' with arguments: {args}, {kwargs}\")\n",
      "        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
      "        print(f\"Function '{func.__name__}' returned: {result}\")\n",
      "        return result\n",
      "    return wrapper\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, when you apply this decorator to a function, it will print debug information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but maybe the user wants the decorator to accept arguments? Oh, the original question didn't specify that. The question is to write a function that implements a decorator. So this example is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the user wants a more complex example. Let me think of another example. For instance, a decorator that counts how many times a function is called.\n",
      "\n",
      "But again, the basic structure is similar. Let me stick with the debug example since it's common and demonstrates the concept well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to consider is preserving the metadata of the original function. Using functools.wraps is important for that. Oh right! Without it, the wrapped function's __name__ and docstring would be lost. So maybe I should include that in the example.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, importing functools and using @functools.wraps(func) on the wrapper.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the updated code would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "import functools\n",
      "\n",
      "def debug(func):\n",
      "    @functools.wraps(func)\n",
      "    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n",
      "        print(f\"Calling function '{func.__name__}' with arguments: {args}, {kwargs}\")\n",
      "        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
      "        print(f\"Function '{func.__name__}' returned: {result}\")\n",
      "        return result\n",
      "    return wrapper\n",
      "\n",
      "This is better practice because it maintains the function's original name and docstring.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting all that together, the final code would include the import and the decorator.\n",
      "\n",
      "Testing this with a sample function:\n",
      "\n",
      "@debug\n",
      "def greet(name):\n",
      "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "Calling function 'greet' with arguments: ('Alice',), {}\n",
      "Function 'greet' returned: Hello, Alice!\n",
      "\n",
      "Which shows the decorator is working.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the answer should present this code as an example of a decorator implemented via a function.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's a solid example. Let me write that out.\n",
      "</think>\n",

      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, I need to write a Python function that implements a decorator. Let me think about how decorators work in Python. Decorators are functions that wrap another function to extend its behavior without modifying its code. They usually take a function as an argument and return a new function.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the basic structure of a decorator is something like:\n",
      "\n",
      "def decorator(func):\n",
      "    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n",
      "        # do something before\n",
      "        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
      "        # do something after\n",
      "        return result\n",
      "    return wrapper\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, you can apply it using the @ syntax above a function.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user wants me to write a function that implements a decorator. Maybe they want an example of a specific decorator? Since they didn't specify, maybe I should create a generic one with some example functionality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me think of a common use case. Maybe a timer decorator that measures the execution time of a function. Or perhaps a simple logger that prints when the function is called.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe a decorator that adds some behavior before and after. For example, a debug decorator that prints the function name and arguments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me go with that. Let's create a decorator called 'debug' that prints the function name and the arguments it was called with, and then returns the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the steps are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Define the decorator function, which takes 'func' as an argument.\n",
      "2. Define the wrapper function inside the decorator. It should accept any arguments (*args, **kwargs).\n",
      "3. Inside the wrapper, print the function name and arguments.\n",
      "4. Call the original function with those arguments.\n",
      "5. Return the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, how to get the arguments? The wrapper will receive them, then pass them to func.\n",
      "\n",
      "Testing this with an example function. Let's say:\n",
      "\n",
      "@debug\n",
      "def add(a, b):\n",
      "    return a + b\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, when add(3, 4) is called, the debug decorator should print something like:\n",
      "\"Calling add with arguments (3, 4), keyword arguments {}\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But how to capture the arguments? In the wrapper, before calling func, we can print args and kwargs.\n",
      "\n",
      "But maybe using the inspect module to get the function's parameters? Hmm, that might complicate things. For simplicity, maybe just print the args and kwargs as they are.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in the wrapper:\n",
      "\n",
      "def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n",
      "    print(f\"Calling {func.__name__} with args {args} and kwargs {kwargs}\")\n",
      "    result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
      "    return result\n",
      "\n",
      "That's straightforward. But maybe the user wants something more complex. However, the question is to write a function that implements a decorator. So this example should suffice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together:\n",
      "\n",
      "def debug(func):\n",
      "    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n",
      "        print(f\"Calling function '{func.__name__}' with arguments: {args}, {kwargs}\")\n",
      "        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
      "        print(f\"Function '{func.__name__}' returned: {result}\")\n",
      "        return result\n",
      "    return wrapper\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, when you apply this decorator to a function, it will print debug information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but maybe the user wants the decorator to accept arguments? Oh, the original question didn't specify that. The question is to write a function that implements a decorator. So this example is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the user wants a more complex example. Let me think of another example. For instance, a decorator that counts how many times a function is called.\n",
      "\n",
      "But again, the basic structure is similar. Let me stick with the debug example since it's common and demonstrates the concept well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to consider is preserving the metadata of the original function. Using functools.wraps is important for that. Oh right! Without it, the wrapped function's __name__ and docstring would be lost. So maybe I should include that in the example.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, importing functools and using @functools.wraps(func) on the wrapper.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the updated code would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "import functools\n",
      "\n",
      "def debug(func):\n",
      "    @functools.wraps(func)\n",
      "    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n",
      "        print(f\"Calling function '{func.__name__}' with arguments: {args}, {kwargs}\")\n",
      "        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
      "        print(f\"Function '{func.__name__}' returned: {result}\")\n",
      "        return result\n",
      "    return wrapper\n",
      "\n",
      "This is better practice because it maintains the function's original name and docstring.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting all that together, the final code would include the import and the decorator.\n",
      "\n",
      "Testing this with a sample function:\n",
      "\n",
      "@debug\n",
      "def greet(name):\n",
      "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "greet(\"Alice\")\n",

      "\n",

      "Function 'greet' returned: Hello, Alice!\n",
      "\n",
      "Which shows the decorator is working.\n",
      "\n",
